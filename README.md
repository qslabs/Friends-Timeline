Friends-Timeline
==========================

This D3 visualization focuses on exposing patterns in co-occurrences of friends and associated activities. For example, you can see how often you see an individual, what friends you see most often together, and what you were doing every time you see a friend. 

A live version is available [here](http://quantifiedself.com/visproject/friend_timeline.html). 

Example Data
------------

The example data included here was generated by a manual data tracking practice. Data was entered in excel. Friends and activities/behaviors were noted on a daily basis. This data visualization is based on an extracted data set that highlights the twenty most often mentioned friends. Thank you to [Max Osterhaus](https://plus.google.com/+MaxOsterhaus/).
